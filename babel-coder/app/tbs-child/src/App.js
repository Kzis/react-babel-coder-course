            I’m in love with the shape of you
            We push and pull like a magnet do
            Although my heart is falling too
            I’m in love with your body
            Last night you were in my room
            And now my bed sheets smell like you
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I’m in love with your body

            I don't wanna live forever
            'Cause I know I'll be livin' in vain
            And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
            I just wanna keep callin' your name
            Until you come back home
            I just wanna keep callin' your name
            Until you come back home
            I just wanna keep callin' your name

            Turn it up, it’s your favorite song
            Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
            Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
            Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
            Yeah, we think we’re free
            Drink, this one is on me
            We’re all chained to the rhythm
            To the rhythm
            To the rhythm
